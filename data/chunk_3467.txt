t in the common room now, can they, not with Hermione there.” He was
talking in a very fast, feverish way. “But what have you got your
broom for, you haven’t been flying, have you?” Harry asked. “I — well
— well, okay, I’ll tell you, but don’t laugh, all right?” Ron said
defensively, turning redder with every second. “I-I thought I’d try
out for Gryffindor Keeper now I’ve got a decent broom. There. Go on.
Laugh.” “I’m not laughing,” said Harry. Ron blinked. “It’s a brilliant
idea! It’d be really cool if you got on the team! I’ve never seen you
play Keeper, are you good?” “I’m not bad,” said Ron, who looked
immensely relieved at Harry’s reaction. “Charlie, Fred, and George
always made me Keep for them when they were training during the
holidays.” “So you’ve been practicing tonight?” “Every evening since
Tuesday . . . just on my own, though, I’ve been trying to bewitch
Quaffles to fly at me, but it hasn’t been easy and I don’t know how
much use it’ll be.” Ron looked nervous and anxious.
