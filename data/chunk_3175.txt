e and live with you?” Sirius smiled sadly. “We’ll see.” “I’d feel a
lot better about the hearing if I knew I didn’t have to go back to the
Dursleys,” Harry pressed him. “They must be bad if you prefer this
place,” said Sirius gloomily. “Hurry up, you two, or there won’t be
any food left,” Mrs. Weasley called. Sirius heaved another great sigh,
cast a dark look at the tapestry, and he and Harry went to join the
others. Harry tried his best not to think about the hearing while they
emptied the glass cabinets that afternoon. Fortunately for him, it was
a job that required a lot of concentration, as many of the objects in
there seemed very reluctant to leave their dusty shelves. Sirius
sustained a bad bite from a silver snuffbox; within seconds, his
bitten hand had developed an unpleasant crusty covering like a tough
brown glove. “It’s okay,” he said, examining the hand with interest
before tapping it lightly with his wand and restoring its skin to
normal, “must be Wartcap powder in there.”
