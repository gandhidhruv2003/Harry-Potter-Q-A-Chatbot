ave seen that there have been not so much leaks as floods concerning
your adventure in the Hall of Prophecy?” “Yes,” said Harry again. “And
now everyone knows that I’m the one —” “No, they do not,” interrupted
Dumbledore. “There are only two people in the whole world who know the
full contents of the prophecy made about you and Lord Voldemort, and
they are both standing in this smelly, spidery broom shed. It is true,
however, that many have guessed, correctly, that Voldemort sent his
Death Eaters to steal a prophecy, and that the prophecy concerned you.
“Now, I think I am correct in saying that you have not told anybody
that you know what the prophecy said?” “No,” said Harry. “A wise
decision, on the whole,” said Dumbledore. “Although I think you ought
to relax it in favor of your friends, Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss
Hermione Granger. Yes,” he continued, when Harry looked startled, “I
think they ought to know. You do them a disservice by not confiding
something this important to them.”
