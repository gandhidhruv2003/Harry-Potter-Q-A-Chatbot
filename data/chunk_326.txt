ad been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn’t paid
attention to where he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he
didn’t recognize where he was at all. There was a suit of armor near
the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there. “You
asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering
around at night, and somebody’s been in the library — Restricted
Section.” Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was,
Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting
nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, “The Restricted
Section? Well, they can’t be far, we’ll catch them.” Harry stood
rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead.
They couldn’t see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if
they came much nearer they’d knock right into him — the Cloak didn’t
stop him from being solid. He backed away as quietly as he could. A
door stood ajar to his left. It was his only hope.
