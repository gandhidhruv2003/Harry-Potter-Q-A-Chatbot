f an hour later Harry took his seat in the hot, over-perfumed
atmosphere of the Divination classroom feeling angry at everybody.
Professor Trelawney was handing out copies of The Dream Oracle yet
again; he would surely be much better employed doing Snape’s
punishment essay than sitting here trying to find meaning in a lot of
made-up dreams. It seemed, however, that he was not the only person in
Divination who was in a temper. Professor Trelawney slammed a copy of
the Oracle down on the table between Harry and Ron and swept away, her
lips pursed; she threw the next copy of the Oracle at Seamus and Dean,
narrowly avoiding Seamus’s head, and thrust the final one into
Neville’s chest with such force that he slipped off his pouf. “Well,
carry on!” said Professor Trelawney loudly, her voice high pitched and
somewhat hysterical. “You know what to do! Or am I such a substandard
teacher that you have never learned how to open a book?” The class
stared perplexedly at her and then at each other.
