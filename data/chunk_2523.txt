 dull clunk on every other step. “Close shave, Potter,” he muttered.
“Yeah . . . I — er . . . thanks,” said Harry weakly. “What is this
thing?” said Moody, drawing the Marauder’s Map out of his pocket and
unfolding it. “Map of Hogwarts,” said Harry, hoping Moody was going to
pull him out of the staircase soon; his leg was really hurting him.
“Merlin’s beard,” Moody whispered, staring at the map, his magical eye
going haywire. “This . . . this is some map, Potter!” “Yeah, it’s . .
. quite useful,” Harry said. His eyes were starting to water from the
pain. “Er — Professor Moody, d’you think you could help me — ?” “What?
Oh! Yes . . . yes, of course . . .” Moody took hold of Harry’s arms
and pulled; Harry’s leg came free of the trick step, and he climbed
onto the one above it. Moody was still gazing at the map. “Potter . .
.” he said slowly, “you didn’t happen, by any chance, to see who broke
into Snape’s office, did you? On this map, I mean?” “Er . . . yeah, I
did . . .” Harry admitted.
