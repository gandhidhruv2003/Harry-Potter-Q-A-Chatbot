r old. He came ter yer house an’— an’— ” Hagrid suddenly pulled out a
very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a
foghorn. “Sorry,” he said. “But it’s that sad — knew yer mum an’ dad,
an’ nicer people yeh couldn’t find — anyway . . . “You-Know-Who killed
’em. An’ then — an’ this is the real myst’ry of the thing — he tried
to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or
maybe he just liked killin’ by then. But he couldn’t do it. Never
wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary
cut. That’s what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh —
took care of yer mum an’ dad an’ yer house, even — but it didn’t work
on you, an’ that’s why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he
decided ter kill ’em, no one except you, an’ he’d killed some o’ the
best witches an’ wizards of the age — the McKinnons, the Bones, the
Prewetts — an’ you was only a baby, an’ you lived.” Something very
painful was going on in Harry’s mind.
