 wooden table with two red- haired people Harry had never seen before,
though he knew immediately who they must be: Bill and Charlie, the two
eldest Weasley brothers. “How’re you doing, Harry?” said the nearer of

shook, feeling calluses and blisters under his fingers. This had to be
Charlie, who worked with dragons in Romania. Charlie was built like
the twins, shorter and stockier than Percy and Ron, who were both long
and lanky. He had a broad, good-natured face, which was weather-beaten
and so freckly that he looked almost tanned; his arms were muscular,
and one of them had a large, shiny burn on it. Bill got to his feet,
smiling, and also shook Harry’s hand. Bill came as something of a
surprise. Harry knew that he worked for the Wizarding bank, Gringotts,
and that Bill had been Head Boy at Hogwarts; Harry had always imagined
Bill to be an older version of Percy: fussy about rule-breaking and
fond of bossing everyone
