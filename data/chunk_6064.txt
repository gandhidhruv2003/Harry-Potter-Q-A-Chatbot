 I should never have married her, I’ve made her an outcast!” Lupin
kicked aside the chair he had overturned. “You have only ever seen me
amongst the Order, or under Dumbledore’s protection at Hogwarts! You
don’t know how most of the Wizarding world sees creatures like me!
When they know of my affliction, they can barely talk to me! Don’t you
see what I’ve done? Even her own family is disgusted by our marriage,
what parents want their only daughter to marry a werewolf? And the
child — the child —” Lupin actually seized handfuls of his own hair;
he looked quite deranged. “My kind don’t usually breed! It will be
like me, I am convinced of it — how can I forgive myself, when I
knowingly risked passing on my own condition to an innocent child? And
if, by some miracle, it is not like me, then it will be better off, a
hundred times so, without a father of whom it must always be ashamed!”
“Remus!” whispered Hermione, tears in her eyes. “Don’t say that — how
could any child be ashamed of you?”
