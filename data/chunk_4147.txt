Filch’s jowls wobbled with silent laughter. “Guilty conscience, eh?”
he wheezed. “Follow me . . .” Harry glanced back at Ron and Hermione,
who were both looking worried. He shrugged and followed Filch back
into the entrance hall, against the tide of hungry students. Filch
seemed to be in an extremely good mood; he hummed creakily under his
breath as they climbed the marble staircase. As they reached the first

nastily. “You filthy little beasts would never have dropped
Stinkpellets if you’d known I had it in my power to whip you raw,
would you, now? Nobody would have thought of throwing Fanged Frisbees
down the corridors if I could’ve strung you up by the ankles in my

Potter, I’ll be allowed to do them things. . .
