piped up Luna. “I’ll go first, shall I?” And as everybody looked at
her, she addressed the dead elf at the bottom of the grave. “Thank you
so much, Dobby, for rescuing me from that cellar. It’s so unfair that
you had to die, when you were so good and brave. I’ll always remember
what you did for us. I hope you’re happy now.” She turned and looked
expectantly at Ron, who cleared his throat and said in a thick voice,
“Yeah . . . thanks, Dobby.” “Thanks,” muttered Dean. Harry swallowed.
“Good-bye, Dobby,” he said. It was all he could manage, but Luna had
said it all for him. Bill raised his wand, and the pile of earth
beside the grave rose up into the air and fell neatly upon it, a
small, reddish mound. “D’you mind if I stay here a moment?” he asked
the others. They murmured words he did not catch; he felt gentle pats
upon his back, and then they all traipsed back toward the cottage,
leaving Harry alone beside the elf.
