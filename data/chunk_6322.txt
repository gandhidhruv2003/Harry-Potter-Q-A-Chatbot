might have been suspended in limbo between Disapparition and
Apparition. He had just held up a hand in front of his face to see
whether he could make out his fingers when it happened. A bright
silver light appeared right ahead of him, moving through the trees.
Whatever the source, it was moving soundlessly. The light seemed
simply to drift toward him. He jumped to his feet, his voice frozen in
his throat, and raised Hermioneâ€™s wand. He screwed up his eyes as the
light became blinding, the trees in front of it pitch-black in
silhouette, and still the thing came closer. . . . And then the source
of the light stepped out from behind an oak. It was a silver-white
doe, moon-bright and dazzling, picking her way over the ground, still
silent, and leaving no hoofprints in the fine powdering of snow. She
stepped toward him, her beautiful head with its wide, long-lashed eyes
held high. Harry stared at the creature, filled with wonder, not at
her strangeness, but at her inexplicable familiarity.
