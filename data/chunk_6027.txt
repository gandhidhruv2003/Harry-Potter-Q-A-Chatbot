in the drawing room upstairs. We threw it out. Did you steal it back?”

look Harry full in the face. Then he said, “Yes.” “Where is it now?”

closed his eyes as though he could not bear to see their reactions to
his next word. “Gone.” “Gone?” echoed Harry, elation flooding out of
him. “What do you mean, it’s gone?”
