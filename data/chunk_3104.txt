egan to yell too, so that Harry actually screwed up his eyes at the
noise and clapped his hands over his ears. Lupin and Mrs. Weasley
darted forward and tried to tug the curtains shut over the old woman,
but they would not close and she screeched louder than ever,
brandishing clawed hands as though trying to tear at their faces.
“Filth! Scum! By-products of dirt and vileness! Half-breeds, mutants,
freaks, begone from this place! How dare you befoul the house of my
fathers —” Tonks apologized over and over again, at the same time
dragging the huge, heavy troll’s leg back off the floor. Mrs. Weasley
abandoned the attempt to close the curtains and hurried up and down
the hall, Stunning all the other portraits with her wand. Then a man
with long black hair came charging out of a door facing Harry. “Shut
up, you horrible old hag, shut UP!” he roared, seizing the curtain
Mrs. Weasley had abandoned. The old woman’s face blanched. “Yoooou!”
she howled, her eyes popping at the sight of the man.
