” said Harry as they all hurried inside the vault. He had described
Hufflepuff’s cup to Ron and Hermione, but if it was the other, unknown
Horcrux that resided in this vault, he did not know what it looked
like. He barely had time to glance around, however, before there was a
muffled clunk from behind them: The door had reappeared, sealing them
inside the vault, and they were plunged into total darkness. “No
matter, Bogrod will be able to release us!” said Griphook as Ron gave
a shout of surprise. “Light your wands, can’t you? And hurry, we have
very little time!” “Lumos!” Harry shone his lit wand around the vault:
Its beam fell upon glittering jewels; he saw the fake sword of
Gryffindor lying on a high shelf amongst a jumble of chains. Ron and
Hermione had lit their wands too, and were now examining the piles of
objects surrounding them. “Harry, could this be — ? Aargh!” Hermione
screamed in pain, and Harry turned his wand on her in time to see a
jeweled goblet tumbling from her grip.
