warts. Fred walked right up to the edge of the line and stood there,
rocking on his toes like a diver preparing for a fifty-foot drop.
Then, with the eyes of every person in the entrance hall upon him, he
took a great breath and stepped over the line. For a split second
Harry thought it had worked — George certainly thought so, for he let
out a yell of triumph and leapt after Fred — but next moment, there
was a loud sizzling sound, and both twins were hurled out of the
golden circle as though they had been thrown by an invisible shot-
putter. They landed painfully, ten feet away on the cold stone floor,
and to add insult to injury, there was a loud popping noise, and both
of them sprouted identical long white beards. The entrance hall rang
with laughter. Even Fred and George joined in, once they had gotten to
their feet and taken a good look at each other’s beards. “I did warn
you,” said a deep, amused voice, and everyone turned to see Professor
Dumbledore coming out of the Great Hall.
