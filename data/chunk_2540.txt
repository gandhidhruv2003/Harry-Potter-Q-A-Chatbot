t Hagrid — perhaps he had to go into the lake sometimes, to deal with
the creatures in it? He looked after everything else on the grounds,
after all — “Yeh’re goin’ ter win,” Hagrid growled, patting Harry’s
shoulder again, so that Harry actually felt himself sink a couple of
inches into the soft ground. “I know it. I can feel it. Yeh’re goin’
ter win, Harry.” Harry just couldn’t bring himself to wipe the happy,
confident smile off Hagrid’s face. Pretending he was interested in the
young unicorns, he forced a smile in return, and moved forward to pat
them with the others. By the evening before the second task, Harry
felt as though he were trapped in a nightmare. He was fully aware that
even if, by some miracle, he managed to find a suitable spell, he’d
have a real job mastering it overnight. How could he have let this
happen? Why hadn’t he got to work on the egg’s clue sooner? Why had he
ever let his mind wander in class — what if a teacher had once
mentioned how to breathe underwater?
