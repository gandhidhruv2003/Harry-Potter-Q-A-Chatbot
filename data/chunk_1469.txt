r as a Howler at once — Ron had got one from his mother the year
before. “Run for it, Neville,” Ron advised. Neville didn’t need
telling twice. He seized the envelope, and holding it before him like
a bomb, sprinted out of the hall, while the Slytherin table exploded
with laughter at the sight of him. They heard the Howler go off in the
entrance hall — Neville’s grandmother’s voice, magically magnified to
a hundred times its usual volume, shrieking about how he had brought
shame on the whole family. Harry was too busy feeling sorry for
Neville to notice immediately that he had a letter too. Hedwig got his
attention by nipping him sharply on the wrist. “Ouch! Oh — thanks,
Hedwig.” Harry tore open the envelope while Hedwig helped herself to
some of Neville’s cornflakes. The note inside said: Dear Harry and
Ron, How about having tea with me this afternoon ’round six? I’ll come
and collect you from the castle. WAIT FOR ME IN THE ENTRANCE HALL;
YOU’RE NOT ALLOWED OUT ON YOUR OWN. Cheers, Ha
