den outbreak of rapping on the door. Hermione gasped; her mug slipped
through her fingers and smashed on the floor; Fang yelped. All four of
them stared at the window beside the doorway. The shadow of somebody
small and squat rippled across the thin curtain. “It’s her!” Ron
whispered. “Get under here!” Harry said quickly; seizing the
Invisibility Cloak he whirled it over himself and Hermione while Ron
tore around the table and dived beneath the Cloak as well. Huddled
together they backed away into a corner. Fang was barking madly at the
door. Hagrid looked thoroughly confused. “Hagrid, hide our mugs!”
Hagrid seized Harry’s and Ron’s mugs and shoved them under the cushion
in Fang’s basket. Fang was now leaping up at the door; Hagrid pushed
him out of the way with his foot and pulled it open. Professor
Umbridge was standing in the doorway wearing her green tweed cloak and
a matching hat with earflaps. Lips pursed, she leaned back so as to
see Hagrid’s face; she barely reached his navel.
