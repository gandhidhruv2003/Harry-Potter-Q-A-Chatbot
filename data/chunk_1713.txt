Marauder’s Map and the Invisibility Cloak into his pocket. It was
Professor Dumbledore. He didn’t look surprised to see Harry there.
“Your carriage is at the gates, Remus,” he said. “Thank you,
Headmaster.” Lupin picked up his old suitcase and the empty grindylow
tank. “Well — good-bye, Harry,” he said, smiling. “It has been a real
pleasure teaching you. I feel sure we’ll meet again sometime.
Headmaster, there is no need to see me to the gates, I can manage. . .
.” Harry had the impression that Lupin wanted to leave as quickly as
possible. “Good-bye, then, Remus,” said Dumbledore soberly. Lupin
shifted the grindylow tank slightly so that he and Dumbledore could
shake hands. Then, with a final nod to Harry and a swift smile, Lupin
left the office. Harry sat down in his vacated chair, staring glumly
at the floor. He heard the door close and looked up.
