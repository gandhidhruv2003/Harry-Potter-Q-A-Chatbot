“Let us walk,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Be very careful not to step
into the water. Stay close to me.” He set off around the edge of the
lake, and Harry followed close behind him. Their footsteps made
echoing, slapping sounds on the narrow rim of rock that surrounded the
water. On and on they walked, but the view did not vary: on one side
of them, the rough cavern wall, on the other, the boundless expanse of
smooth, glassy blackness, in the very middle of which was that
mysterious greenish glow. Harry found the place and the silence
oppressive, unnerving. “Professor?” he said finally. “Do you think the
Horcrux is here?” “Oh yes,” said Dumbledore. “Yes, I’m sure it is. The
question is, how do we get to it?” “We couldn’t . . . we couldn’t just
try a Summoning Charm?” Harry said, sure that it was a stupid
suggestion. But he was much keener than he was prepared to admit on
getting out of this place as soon as possible.
