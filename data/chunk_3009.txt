 AGAIN! I WILL NOT HAVE ANY MORE OWLS IN MY HOUSE!” But Harry was
already ripping open the envelope and pulling out the letter inside,
his heart pounding somewhere in the region of his Adam’s apple. Dear
Mr. Potter, We have received intelligence that you performed the
Patronus Charm at twenty-three minutes past nine this evening in a
Muggle-inhabited area and in the presence of a Muggle. The severity of
this breach of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage
Sorcery has resulted in your expulsion from Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry. Ministry representatives will be calling at
your place of residence shortly to destroy your wand. As you have
already received an official warning for a previous offense under
section 13 of the International Confederation of Wizards’ Statute of
Secrecy, we regret to inform you that your presence is required at a
disciplinary hearing at the Ministry of Magic at 9 A.M. on August
12th. Hoping you are well, Yours sincerely, IMPROPER USE
