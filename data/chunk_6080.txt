en to sit beside number thirteen. And yet the square was now
attracting a trickle of visitors who seemed to find the anomaly most
intriguing. Barely a day passed without one or two people arriving in
Grimmauld Place with no other purpose, or so it seemed, than to lean
against the railings facing numbers eleven and thirteen, watching the
join between the two houses. The lurkers were never the same two days
running, although they all seemed to share a dislike for normal
clothing. Most of the Londoners who passed them were used to eccentric
dressers and took little notice, though occasionally one of them might
glance back, wondering why anyone would wear such long cloaks in this
heat. The watchers seemed to be gleaning little satisfaction from
their vigil. Occasionally one of them started forward excitedly, as if
they had seen something interesting at last, only to fall back looking
disappointed. On the first day of September there were more people
lurking in the square than ever before.
