ost certainly underground — more of a dungeon than a room, he thought.
There was a bleak and forbidding air about the place; there were no
pictures on the walls, no decorations at all; just these serried rows
of benches, rising in levels all around the room, all positioned so
that they had a clear view of that chair with the chains on its arms.
Before Harry could reach any conclusions about the place in which they
were, he heard footsteps. The door in the corner of the dungeon opened
and three people entered — or at least one man, flanked by two
dementors. Harry’s insides went cold. The dementors — tall, hooded
creatures whose faces were concealed — were gliding slowly toward the
chair in the center of the room, each grasping one of the man’s arms
with their dead and rotten- looking hands. The man between them looked
as though he was about to faint, and Harry couldn’t blame him . . . he
knew the dementors could not touch him inside a memory, but he
remembered their power only too well.
