 it’s an extraordinarily dangerous thing to have in a house!” “How
d’you know it’s an Erumpent horn?” asked Ron, edging away from the
horn as fast as he could, given the extreme clutter of the room.
“There’s a description in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them! Mr.
Lovegood, you need to get rid of it straightaway, don’t you know it
can explode at the slightest touch?” “The Crumple-Horned Snorkack,”
said Xenophilius very clearly, a mulish look upon his face, “is a shy
and highly magical creature, and its horn —” “Mr. Lovegood, I
recognize the grooved markings around the base, that’s an Erumpent
horn and it’s incredibly dangerous — I don’t know where you got it —”
“I bought it,” said Xenophilius dogmatically, “two weeks ago, from a
delightful young wizard who knew of my interest in the exquisite
Snorkack. A Christmas surprise for my Luna. Now,” he said, turning to
Harry, “why exactly have you come here, Mr. Potter?” “We need some
help,” said Harry, before Hermione could start again.
