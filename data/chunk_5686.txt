f Percy, apart from stabbing pieces of kipper with unwonted venom.
Over at the Slytherin table Crabbe and Goyle were muttering together.
Hulking boys though they were, they looked oddly lonely without the
tall, pale figure of Malfoy between them, bossing them around. Harry
had not spared Malfoy much thought. His animosity was all for Snape,
but he had not forgotten the fear in Malfoy’s voice on that tower top,
nor the fact that he had lowered his wand before the other Death
Eaters arrived. Harry did not believe that Malfoy would have killed
Dumbledore. He despised Malfoy still for his infatuation with the Dark
Arts, but now the tiniest drop of pity mingled with his dislike.
Where, Harry wondered, was Malfoy now, and what was Voldemort making
him do under threat of killing him and his parents? Harry’s thoughts
were interrupted by a nudge in the ribs from Ginny. Professor
McGonagall had risen to her feet, and the mournful hum in the Hall
died away at once. “It is nearly time,” she said.
