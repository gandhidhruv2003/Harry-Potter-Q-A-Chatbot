imneys, and television aerials. He wanted to reach the ground very
much, though he felt sure that someone would have to unfreeze him from
his broom. “Here we go!” called Tonks, and a few seconds later she had
landed. Harry touched down right behind her and dismounted on a patch
of unkempt grass in the middle of a small square. Tonks was already
unbuckling Harry’s trunk. Shivering, Harry looked around. The grimy
fronts of the surrounding houses were not welcoming; some of them had
broken windows, glimmering dully in the light from the streetlamps,
paint was peeling from many of the doors, and heaps of rubbish lay
outside several sets of front steps. “Where are we?” Harry asked, but
Lupin said quietly, “In a minute.” Moody was rummaging in his cloak,
his gnarled hands clumsy with cold. “Got it,” he muttered, raising
what looked like a silver cigarette lighter into the air and clicking
it. The nearest streetlamp went out with a pop. He clicked the
unlighter again; the next lamp went out.
