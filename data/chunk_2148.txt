Hagrid?” Harry called. “Thrivin’,” Hagrid called back happily. “Yeah,
I’ll just bet they are,” said Ron quietly. “Looks like they’ve finally
found a food they like, doesn’t it? Hagrid’s fingers.” At that moment,
a voice said, “Excuse me, are you wanting ze bouillabaisse?” It was
the girl from Beauxbatons who had laughed during Dumbledore’s speech.
She had finally removed her muffler. A long sheet of silvery-blonde
hair fell almost to her waist. She had large, deep blue eyes, and very
white, even teeth. Ron went purple. He stared up at her, opened his
mouth to reply, but nothing came out except a faint gurgling noise.
“Yeah, have it,” said Harry, pushing the dish toward the girl. “You
’ave finished wiz it?” “Yeah,” Ron said breathlessly. “Yeah, it was
excellent.” The girl picked up the dish and carried it carefully off
to the Ravenclaw table. Ron was still goggling at the girl as though
he had never seen one before. Harry started to laugh. The sound seemed
to jog Ron back to his senses.
