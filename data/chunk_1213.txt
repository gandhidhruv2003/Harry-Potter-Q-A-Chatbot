w, get a move on!” he called as the class approached. “Got a real
treat for yeh today! Great lesson comin’ up! Everyone here? Right,
follow me!” For one nasty moment, Harry thought that Hagrid was going
to lead them into the forest; Harry had had enough unpleasant
experiences in there to last him a lifetime. However, Hagrid strolled
off around the edge of the trees, and five minutes later, they found
themselves outside a kind of paddock. There was nothing in there.
“Everyone gather ’round the fence here!” he called. “That’s it — make
sure yeh can see — now, firs’ thing yeh’ll want ter do is open yer
books —” “How?” said the cold, drawling voice of Draco Malfoy. “Eh?”
said Hagrid. “How do we open our books?” Malfoy repeated. He took out
his copy of The Monster Book of Monsters, which he had bound shut with
a length of rope. Other people took theirs out too; some, like Harry,
had belted their book shut; others had crammed them inside tight bags
or clamped them together with binder clips.
