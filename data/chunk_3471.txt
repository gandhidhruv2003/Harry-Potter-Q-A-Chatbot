might lighten his present darkness; he had never had a worse first
week of term at Hogwarts. At five o’clock that evening he knocked on
Professor Umbridge’s office door for what he sincerely hoped would be
the final time, was told to enter and did so. The blank parchment lay
ready for him on the lace-covered table, the pointed black quill
beside it. “You know what to do, Mr. Potter,” said Umbridge, smiling
sweetly over at him. Harry picked up the quill and glanced through the
window. If he just shifted his chair an inch or so to the right . . .
On the pretext of shifting himself closer to the table he managed it.
He now had a distant view of the Gryffindor Quidditch team soaring up
and down the pitch, while half a dozen black figures stood at the foot
of the three high goalposts, apparently awaiting their turn to Keep.
It was impossible to tell which one was Ron at this distance. I must
not tell lies, Harry wrote. The cut in the back of his right hand
opened and began to bleed afresh.
