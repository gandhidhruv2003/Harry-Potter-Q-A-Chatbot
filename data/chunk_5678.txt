“R.A.B.?” said Harry, sitting up straight. He did not feel the way he
had so often felt before, excited, curious, burning to get to the

truth about the real Horcrux had to be completed before he could move
a little farther along the dark and winding path stretching ahead of
him, the path that he and Dumbledore had set out upon together, and
which he now knew he would have to journey alone. There might still be
as many as four Horcruxes out there somewhere, and each would need to
be found and eliminated before there was even a possibility that
Voldemort could be killed. He kept reciting their names to himself, as
though by listing them he could bring them within reach: the locket .
. . the cup . . . the snake . . . something of Gryffindor’s or
Ravenclaw’s . . . the locket . . . the cup . . . the snake . . .
