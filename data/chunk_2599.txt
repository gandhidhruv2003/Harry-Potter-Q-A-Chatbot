ing a pair patterned with flashing gold and silver stars, and another
that screamed loudly when they became too smelly. Then, at half past
one, they made their way up the High Street, past Dervish and Banges,
and out toward the edge of the village. Harry had never been in this
direction before. The winding lane was leading them out into the wild
countryside around Hogsmeade. The cottages were fewer here, and their
gardens larger; they were walking toward the foot of the mountain in
whose shadow Hogsmeade lay. Then they turned a corner and saw a stile
at the end of the lane. Waiting for them, its front paws on the
topmost bar, was a very large, shaggy black dog, which was carrying
some newspapers in its mouth and looking very familiar. . . . “Hello,
Sirius,” said Harry when they had reached him. The black dog sniffed
Harry’s bag eagerly, wagged its tail once, then turned and began to
trot away from them across the scrubby patch of ground that rose to
meet the rocky foot of the mountain.
