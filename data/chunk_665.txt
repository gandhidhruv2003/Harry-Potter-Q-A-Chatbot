had to buy their way in,” said Hermione sharply. “They got in on pure
talent.” The smug look on Malfoy’s face flickered. “No one asked your
opinion, you filthy little Mudblood,” he spat. Harry knew at once that
Malfoy had said something really bad because there was an instant
uproar at his words. Flint had to dive in front of Malfoy to stop Fred
and George jumping on him, Alicia shrieked, “How dare you!”, and Ron
plunged his hand into his robes, pulled out his wand, yelling, “You’ll
pay for that one, Malfoy!” and pointed it furiously under Flint’s arm
at Malfoy’s face. A loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of
green light shot out of the wrong end of Ron’s wand, hitting him in
the stomach and sending him reeling backward onto the grass. “Ron!
Ron! Are you all right?” squealed Hermione. Ron opened his mouth to
speak, but no words came out. Instead he gave an almighty belch and
several slugs dribbled out of his mouth onto his lap. The Slytherin
team were paralyzed with laughter.
