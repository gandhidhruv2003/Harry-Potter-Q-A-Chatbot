successfully asked out Cho Chang was insufficient to lighten the
ominous feelings that intensified with every step Harry took toward
Snape’s office. He paused outside the door when he reached it, wishing
he were almost anywhere else, then, taking a deep breath, knocked, and
entered. It was a shadowy room lined with shelves bearing hundreds of
glass jars in which floated slimy bits of animals and plants,
suspended in variously colored potions. In a corner stood the cupboard
full of ingredients that Snape had once accused Harry — not without
reason — of robbing. Harry’s attention was drawn toward the desk,
however, where a shallow stone basin engraved with runes and symbols
lay in a pool of candlelight. Harry recognized it at once —
Dumbledore’s Pensieve. Wondering what on earth it was doing here, he
jumped when Snape’s cold voice came out of the corner.
