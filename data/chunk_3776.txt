in, taking in every tiny detail within, from the haversack against the
wall to the abandoned traveling cloak. “I am now the Defense Against
the Dark Arts teacher —” “Tha’s brave of yeh,” said Hagrid, “there’s
not many’d take tha’ job anymore —” “— and Hogwarts High Inquisitor,”
said Umbridge, giving no sign that she had heard him. “Wha’s that?”
said Hagrid, frowning. “Precisely what I was going to ask,” said
Umbridge, pointing at the broken shards of china on the floor that had
been Hermione’s mug. “Oh,” said Hagrid, with a most unhelpful glance
toward the corner where Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood hidden, “oh,
tha’ was . . . was Fang. He broke a mug. So I had ter use this one
instead.” Hagrid pointed to the mug from which he had been drinking,
one hand still clamped over the dragon steak pressed to his eye.
Umbridge stood facing him now, taking in every detail of his
appearance instead of the cabin’s. “I heard voices,” she said quietly.
“I was talkin’ ter Fang,” said Hagrid stoutly.
