don’t really understand.” To be polite, he took a sip from his cup
too, and almost gagged: The stuff was quite disgusting, as though
someone had liquidized bogey-flavored Every Flavor Beans. “Well, you
see, believers seek the Deathly Hallows,” said Xenophilius, smacking
his lips in apparent appreciation of the Gurdyroot infusion. “But what
are the Deathly Hallows?” asked Hermione. Xenophilius set aside his
empty teacup. “I assume that you are all familiar with ‘The Tale of
the Three Brothers’?” Harry said, “No,” but Ron and Hermione both
said, “Yes.” Xenophilius nodded gravely. “Well, well, Mr. Potter, the
whole thing starts with ‘The Tale of the Three Brothers’ . . . I have
a copy somewhere. . . .” He glanced vaguely around the room, at the
piles of parchment and books, but Hermione said, “I’ve got a copy, Mr.
Lovegood, I’ve got it right here.” And she pulled out The Tales of
Beedle the Bard from the small, beaded bag.
