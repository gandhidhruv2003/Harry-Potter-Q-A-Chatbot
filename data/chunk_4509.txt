first time, Dumbledore sounded frightened. Harry could not see why.
The hall was quite empty but for themselves, the sobbing Bellatrix
still trapped under her statue, and the tiny baby Fawkes croaking
feebly on the floor — And then Harry’s scar burst open. He knew he was
dead: it was pain beyond imagining, pain past endurance — He was gone
from the hall, he was locked in the coils of a creature with red eyes,
so tightly bound that Harry did not know where his body ended and the
creature’s began. They were fused together, bound by pain, and there
was no escape — And when the creature spoke, it used Harry’s mouth, so
that in his agony he felt his jaw move. . . . “Kill me now, Dumbledore
. . .” Blinded and dying, every part of him screaming for release,
Harry felt the creature use him again. . . . “If death is nothing,
Dumbledore, kill the boy . . .” Let the pain stop, thought Harry. Let
him kill us. . . . End it, Dumbledor
