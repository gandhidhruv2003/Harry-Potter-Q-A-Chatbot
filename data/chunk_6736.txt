of the corridor into which she had disappeared, he saw her at the very
end of the passage, still gliding smoothly away from him. “Hey — wait
— come back!” She consented to pause, floating a few inches from the
ground. Harry supposed that she was beautiful, with her waist-length
hair and floor-length cloak, but she also looked haughty and proud.
Close to, he recognized her as a ghost he had passed several times in
the corridor, but to whom he had never spoken. “You’re the Gray Lady?”
She nodded but did not speak. “The ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?” “That is
correct.” Her tone was not encouraging. “Please: I need some help. I
need to know anything you can tell me about the lost diadem.” A cold
smile curved her lips. “I am afraid,” she said, turning to leave,
“that I cannot help you.” “WAIT!” He had not meant to shout, but anger
and panic were threatening to overwhelm him. He glanced at his watch
as she hovered in front of him: It was a quarter to midnight. “This is
urgent,” he said fiercely.
