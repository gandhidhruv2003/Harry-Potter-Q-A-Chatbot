Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were climbing the stairs. The bottle of rat tonic
was lying under the table they had sat at earlier. Harry waited until
he heard Mr. and Mrs. Weasley’s bedroom door close, then headed back
upstairs with the bottle. Fred and George were crouching in the
shadows on the landing, heaving with laughter as they listened to
Percy dismantling his and Ron’s room in search of his badge. “We’ve
got it,” Fred whispered to Harry. “We’ve been improving it.” The badge
now read Bighead Boy. Harry forced a laugh, went to give Ron the rat
tonic, then shut himself in his room and lay down on his bed. So
Sirius Black was after him. That explained everything. Fudge had been
lenient with him because he was so relieved to find him alive. He’d
made Harry promise to stay in Diagon Alley where there were plenty of
wizards to keep an eye on him. And he was sending two Ministry cars to
take them all to the station tomorrow, so that the Weasleys could look
after Harry until he was on the train
