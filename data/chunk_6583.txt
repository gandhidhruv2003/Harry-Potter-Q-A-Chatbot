he cliff: He was going to miss the sound. Small green shoots were
forcing their way up through the red earth of Dobby’s grave now; in a
year’s time the mound would be covered in flowers. The white stone
that bore the elf’s name had already acquired a weathered look. He
realized now that they could hardly have laid Dobby to rest in a more
beautiful place, but Harry ached with sadness to think of leaving him
behind. Looking down on the grave, he wondered yet again how the elf
had known where to come to rescue them. His fingers moved
absentmindedly to the little pouch still strung around his neck,
through which he could feel the jagged mirror fragment in which he had
been sure he had seen Dumbledore’s eye. Then the sound of a door
opening made him look around. Bellatrix Lestrange was striding across
the lawn toward them, accompanied by Griphook. As she walked, she was
tucking the small, beaded bag into the inside pocket of another set of
the old robes they had taken from Grimmauld Place.
