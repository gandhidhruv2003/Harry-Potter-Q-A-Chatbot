nd Hedwig’s cage toward Uncle Vernon, who greeted him in his usual
fashion. “What’s that?” he snarled, staring at the envelope Harry was
still clutching in his hand. “If it’s another form for me to sign,
you’ve got another —” “It’s not,” said Harry cheerfully. “It’s a
letter from my godfather.” “Godfather?” spluttered Uncle Vernon. “You
haven’t got a godfather!” “Yes, I have,” said Harry brightly. “He was
my mum and dad’s best friend. He’s a convicted murderer, but he’s
broken out of Wizard prison and he’s on the run. He likes to keep in
touch with me, though . . . keep up with my news . . . check if I’m
happy. . . .” And, grinning broadly at the look of horror on Uncle
Vernon’s face, Harry set off toward the station exit, Hedwig rattling
along in front of him, for what looked like a much better summer than
the last.   Text copyright © 1999 by J.K. Rowling. Cover illustration
