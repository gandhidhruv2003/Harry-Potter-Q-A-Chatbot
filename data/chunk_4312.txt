fifth years ate lunch with the rest of the school (the four House
tables reappeared over the lunch hour) and then trooped off into the
small chamber beside the Great Hall, where they were to wait until
called for their practical examination. As small groups of students
were called forward in alphabetical order, those left behind muttered
incantations and practiced wand movements, occasionally poking one
another in the back or eye by mistake. Hermione’s name was called.
Trembling, she left the chamber with Anthony Goldstein, Gregory Goyle,
and Daphne Greengrass. Students who had already been tested did not
return afterward, so Harry and Ron had no idea how Hermione had done.
“She’ll be fine — remember she got a hundred and twelve percent on one
of our Charms tests?” said Ron. Ten minutes later, Professor Flitwick
called, “Parkinson, Pansy — Patil, Padma — Patil, Parvati — Potter,
