find a decent bruise remover. We’re testing most of our products on
ourselves.” Hermione looked nervous. “It is safe, isn’t it?” she
asked. “’Course it is,” said Fred bracingly. “Come on, Harry, I’ll

card and rope tricks. “Muggle magic tricks!” said Fred happily,
pointing them out. “For freaks like Dad, you know, who love Muggle

they’re great novelties. . . . Oh, here’s George. . . .” Fred’s twin
shook Harry’s hand energetically. “Giving him the tour? Come through
the back, Harry, that’s where we’re making the real money — pocket
anything, you, and you’ll pay in more than Galleons!” he added
warningly to a small boy who hastily whipped his hand out of the tub
