 second?” “Well, a second’s there to take over if you die,” said Ron
casually, getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look
on Harry’s face, he added quickly, “But people only die in proper
duels, you know, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy’ll be able
to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic
to do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.” “And
what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?” “Throw it away and punch
him on the nose,” Ron suggested. “Excuse me.” They both looked up. It
was Hermione Granger. “Can’t a person eat in peace in this place?”
said Ron. Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry. “I couldn’t help
overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying —” “Bet you could,” Ron
muttered. “— and you mustn’t go wandering around the school at night,
think of the points you’ll lose Gryffindor if you’re caught, and
you’re bound to be. It’s really very selfish of you.” “And it’s really
none of your business,” said Harry.
