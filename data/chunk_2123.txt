ind the teachers’ table, the largest banner of all bore the Hogwarts
coat of arms: lion, eagle, badger, and snake united around a large
letter H. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down beside Fred and George at
the Gryffindor table. Once again, and most unusually, they were
sitting apart from everyone else and conversing in low voices. Ron led
the way over to them. “It’s a bummer, all right,” George was saying
gloomily to Fred. “But if he won’t talk to us in person, we’ll have to
send him the letter after all. Or we’ll stuff it into his hand. He
can’t avoid us forever.” “Who’s avoiding you?” said Ron, sitting down
next to them. “Wish you would,” said Fred, looking irritated at the
interruption. “What’s a bummer?” Ron asked George. “Having a nosy git
like you for a brother,” said George. “You two got any ideas on the
Triwizard Tournament yet?” Harry asked. “Thought any more about trying
to enter?” “I asked McGonagall how the champions are chosen but she
wasn’t telling,” said George bitterly.
