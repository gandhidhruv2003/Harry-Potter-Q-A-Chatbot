 to distant crackles of twigs, soft swishes of snow. Was he about to
be attacked? Had she enticed him into an ambush? Was he imagining that
somebody stood beyond the reach of the wandlight, watching him? He
held the wand higher. Nobody ran out at him, no flash of green light
burst from behind a tree. Why, then, had she led him to this spot?
Something gleamed in the light of the wand, and Harry spun about, but
all that was there was a small, frozen pool, its cracked black surface
glittering as he raised the wand higher to examine it. He moved
forward rather cautiously and looked down. The ice reflected his
distorted shadow and the beam of wandlight, but deep below the thick,
misty gray carapace, something else glinted. A great silver cross . .
. His heart skipped into his mouth: He dropped to his knees at the
poolâ€™s edge and angled the wand so as to flood the bottom of the pool
with as much light as possible. A glint of deep red . . . It was a
sword with glittering rubies in its hilt. .
