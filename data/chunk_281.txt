 Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher? “If they hadn’t found
me, I’d be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked
it out with its own club. They didn’t have time to come and fetch
anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived.” Harry and
Ron tried to look as though this story wasn’t new to them. “Well — in
that case . . .” said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of
them, “Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling
a mountain troll on your own?” Hermione hung her head. Harry was
speechless. Hermione was the last person to do anything against the
rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of
trouble. It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets. “Miss
Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,” said
Professor McGonagall. “I’m very disappointed in you. If you’re not
hurt at all, you’d better get off to Gryffindor Tower. Students are
finishing the feast in their Houses.” Hermione left.
