home with us.” “But you can’t magic me out either —” “We don’t need
to,” said Ron, jerking his head toward the front seat and grinning.
“You forget who I’ve got with me.” “Tie that around the bars,” said
Fred, throwing the end of a rope to Harry. “If the Dursleys wake up,
I’m dead,” said Harry as he tied the rope tightly around a bar and
Fred revved up the car. “Don’t worry,” said Fred, “and stand back.”
Harry moved back into the shadows next to Hedwig, who seemed to have
realized how important this was and kept still and silent. The car
revved louder and louder and suddenly, with a crunching noise, the
bars were pulled clean out of the window as Fred drove straight up in
the air. Harry ran back to the window to see the bars dangling a few
feet above the ground. Panting, Ron hoisted them up into the car.
Harry listened anxiously, but there was no sound from the Dursleys’
bedroom. When the bars were safely in the back seat with Ron, Fred
reversed as close as possible to Harry’s window.
