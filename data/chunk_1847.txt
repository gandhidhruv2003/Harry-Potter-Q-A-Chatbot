le. The whole Ministry’s been working on it for months. First, of
course, we have to stagger the arrivals. People with cheaper tickets
have to arrive two weeks beforehand. A limited number use Muggle
transport, but we can’t have too many clogging up their buses and
trains — remember, wizards are coming from all over the world. Some
Apparate, of course, but we have to set up safe points for them to
appear, well away from Muggles. I believe there’s a handy wood they’re
using as the Apparition point. For those who don’t want to Apparate,
or can’t, we use Portkeys. They’re objects that are used to transport
wizards from one spot to another at a prearranged time. You can do
large groups at a time if you need to. There have been two hundred
Portkeys placed at strategic points around Britain, and the nearest
one to us is up at the top of Stoatshead Hill, so that’s where we’re
headed.” Mr. Weasley pointed ahead of them, where a large black mass
rose beyond the village of Ottery St. Catchpole.
