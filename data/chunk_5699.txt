o alone now.” She did not cry, she simply looked at him. “Voldemort
uses people his enemies are close to. He’s already used you as bait
once, and that was just because you’re my best friend’s sister. Think
how much danger you’ll be in if we keep this up. He’ll know, he’ll
find out. He’ll try and get to me through you.” “What if I don’t
care?” said Ginny fiercely. “I care,” said Harry. “How do you think
I’d feel if this was your funeral . . . and it was my fault. . . .”
She looked away from him, over the lake. “I never really gave up on
you,” she said. “Not really. I always hoped. . . . Hermione told me to
get on with life, maybe go out with some other people, relax a bit
around you, because I never used to be able to talk if you were in the
room, remember? And she thought you might take a bit more notice if I
was a bit more — myself.” “Smart girl, that Hermione,” said Harry,
trying to smile. “I just wish I’d asked you sooner. We could’ve had
ages . . . months . . . years maybe. . . .”
