e Feasts — It’s Magic! And unless Harry’s ears were deceiving him, the
old radio next to the sink had just announced that coming up was
“Witching Hour, with the popular singing sorceress, Celestina
Warbeck.” Mrs. Weasley was clattering around, cooking breakfast a
little haphazardly, throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw
sausages into the frying pan. Every now and then she muttered things
like “don’t know what you were thinking of,” and “never would have
believed it.” “I don’t blame you, dear,” she assured Harry, tipping
eight or nine sausages onto his plate. “Arthur and I have been worried
about you, too. Just last night we were saying we’d come and get you
ourselves if you hadn’t written back to Ron by Friday. But really”
(she was now adding three fried eggs to his plate), “flying an illegal
car halfway across the country — anyone could have seen you —” She
flicked her wand casually at the dishes in the sink, which began to
clean themselves, clinking gently in the background.
