ry glanced down and felt another dull blow to his stomach: Colin
Creevey, though underage, must have sneaked back just as Malfoy,
Crabbe, and Goyle had done. He was tiny in death. “You know what? I
can manage him alone, Neville,” said Oliver Wood, and he heaved Colin
over his shoulder in a fireman’s lift and carried him into the Great
Hall. Neville leaned against the door frame for a moment and wiped his
forehead with the back of his hand. He looked like an old man. Then he
set off down the steps again into the darkness to recover more bodies.
Harry took one glance back at the entrance of the Great Hall. People
were moving around, trying to comfort each other, drinking, kneeling
beside the dead, but he could not see any of the people he loved, no
hint of Hermione, Ron, Ginny, or any of the other Weasleys, no Luna.
He felt he would have given all the time remaining to him for just one
last look at them; but then, would he ever have the strength to stop
looking? It was better like this.
