ver breakfast at number four, Privet Drive. Mr. Vernon Dursley had
been woken in the early hours of the morning by a loud, hooting noise
from his nephew Harry’s room. “Third time this week!” he roared across
the table. “If you can’t control that owl, it’ll have to go!” Harry
tried, yet again, to explain. “She’s bored,” he said. “She’s used to
flying around outside. If I could just let her out at night —” “Do I
look stupid?” snarled Uncle Vernon, a bit of fried egg dangling from
his bushy mustache. “I know what’ll happen if that owl’s let out.” He
exchanged dark looks with his wife, Petunia. Harry tried to argue back
but his words were drowned by a long, loud belch from the Dursleys’
son, Dudley. “I want more bacon.” “There’s more in the frying pan,
sweetums,” said Aunt Petunia, turning misty eyes on her massive son.
“We must build you up while we’ve got the chance. . . . I don’t like
the sound of that school food. . . .” “Nonsense, Petunia, I never went
hungry when I was at Smeltings,”
