screechy wailing, filled the room. The nearest thing to it Harry had
ever heard was the ghost orchestra at Nearly Headless Nick’s deathday
party, who had all been playing the musical saw. “Shut it!” Fred
bellowed, his hands over his ears. “What was that?” said Seamus
Finnigan, staring at the egg as Harry slammed it shut again.
