 into his mind burst the vision of an emaciated old man lying in rags
upon a stone floor, screaming, a horrible, drawn-out scream, a scream
of unendurable agony. . . . “No! No! I beg you, I beg you. . . .” “You
lied to Lord Voldemort, Ollivander!” “I did not. . . . I swear I did
not. . . .” “You sought to help Potter, to help him escape me!” “I
swear I did not . . . I believed a different wand would work. . . .”
“Explain, then, what happened. Lucius’s wand is destroyed!” “I cannot
understand . . . The connection . . . exists only . . . between your
two wands. . . .” “Lies!” “Please . . . I beg you. . . .” And Harry
saw the white hand raise its wand and felt Voldemort’s surge of
vicious anger, saw the frail old man on the floor writhe in agony —
“Harry?” It was over as quickly as it had come: Harry stood shaking in
the darkness, clutching the gate into the garden, his heart racing,
his scar still tingling. It was several moments before he realized
that Ron and Hermione were at his side.
