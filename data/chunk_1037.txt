 medieval times, but not very good at recognizing it. On the rare
occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard, burning had no
effect whatsoever. The witch or wizard would perform a basic Flame-
Freezing Charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a
gentle, tickling sensation. Indeed, Wendelin the Weird enjoyed being
burned so much that she allowed herself to be caught no less than
forty-seven times in various disguises. Harry put his quill between
his teeth and reached underneath his pillow for his ink bottle and a
roll of parchment. Slowly and very carefully he unscrewed the ink
bottle, dipped his quill into it, and began to write, pausing every
now and then to listen, because if any of the Dursleys heard the
scratching of his quill on their way to the bathroom, heâ€™d probably
find himself locked in the cupboard under the stairs for the rest of
the summer. The Dursley family of number four, Privet Drive, was the
reason that Harry never enjoyed his summer holidays.
