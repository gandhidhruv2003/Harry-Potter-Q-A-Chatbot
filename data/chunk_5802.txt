ksack slipped from beneath his knees — “No — HEDWIG!” The broomstick
spun to earth, but he just managed to seize the strap of his rucksack
and the top of the cage as the motorbike swung the right way up again.
A second’s relief, and then another burst of green light. The owl
screeched and fell to the floor of the cage. “No — NO!” The motorbike
zoomed forward; Harry glimpsed hooded Death Eaters scattering as
Hagrid blasted through their circle. “Hedwig — Hedwig —” But the owl
lay motionless and pathetic as a toy on the floor of her cage. He
could not take it in, and his terror for the others was paramount. He
glanced over his shoulder and saw a mass of people moving, flares of
green light, two pairs of people on brooms soaring off into the
distance, but he could not tell who they were — “Hagrid, we’ve got to
go back, we’ve got to go back!” he yelled over the thunderous roar of
the engine, pulling out his wand, ramming Hedwig’s cage onto the
floor, refusing to believe that she was dead.
