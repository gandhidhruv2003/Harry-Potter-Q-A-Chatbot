 to go careful.” There was a little silence. Lily had picked up a
fallen twig and twirled it in the air, and Harry knew that she was
imagining sparks trailing from it. Then she dropped the twig, leaned
in toward the boy, and said, “It is real, isn’t it? It’s not a joke?
Petunia says you’re lying to me. Petunia says there isn’t a Hogwarts.
It is real, isn’t it?” “It’s real for us,” said Snape. “Not for her.
But we’ll get the letter, you and me.” “Really?” whispered Lily.
“Definitely,” said Snape, and even with his poorly cut hair and his
odd clothes, he struck an oddly impressive figure sprawled in front of
her, brimful of confidence in his destiny. “And will it really come by
owl?” Lily whispered. “Normally,” said Snape. “But you’re Muggle-born,
so someone from the school will have to come and explain to your
parents.” “Does it make a difference, being Muggle-born?” Snape
hesitated. His black eyes, eager in the greenish gloom, moved over the
pale face, the dark red hair. “No,” he said.
