who looked very white and somehow much younger than usual, came
splashing out to meet them. Meanwhile Madame Maxime was trying to
restrain Fleur Delacour, who was quite hysterical, fighting tooth and
nail to return to the water. “Gabrielle! Gabrielle! Is she alive? Is
she ’urt?” “She’s fine!” Harry tried to tell her, but he was so
exhausted he could hardly talk, let alone shout. Percy seized Ron and
was dragging him back to the bank (“Gerroff, Percy, I’m all right!”);
Dumbledore and Bagman were pulling Harry upright; Fleur had broken
free of Madame Maxime and was hugging her sister. “It was ze
grindylows . . . zey attacked me . . . oh Gabrielle, I thought . . . I
thought . . .” “Come here, you,” said Madam Pomfrey. She seized Harry
and pulled him over to Hermione and the others, wrapped him so tightly
in a blanket that he felt as though he were in a straitjacket, and
forced a measure of very hot potion down his throat.
