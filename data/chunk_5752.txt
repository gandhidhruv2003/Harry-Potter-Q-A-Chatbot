 later years pleading for tolerance, he wasn’t exactly broad-minded
when he was younger! Yes, Albus Dumbledore had an extremely murky
past, not to mention that very fishy family, which he worked so hard
to keep hushed up.” I ask whether Skeeter is referring to Dumbledore’s
brother, Aberforth, whose conviction by the Wizengamot for misuse of
magic caused a minor scandal fifteen years ago. “Oh, Aberforth is just
the tip of the dung heap,” laughs Skeeter. “No, no, I’m talking about
much worse than a brother with a fondness for fiddling about with
goats, worse even than the Muggle-maiming father — Dumbledore couldn’t
keep either of them quiet anyway, they were both charged by the
Wizengamot. No, it’s the mother and the sister that intrigued me, and
a little digging uncovered a positive nest of nastiness — but, as I
say, you’ll have to wait for chapters nine to twelve for full details.
All I can say now is, it’s no wonder Dumbledore never talked about how
his nose got broken.” Family skelet
