thought the chap was asking to borrow a pair of tweezers. Bit of a
strong accent.” “Mr. Crouch!” said Percy breathlessly, sunk into a
kind of half-bow that made him look like a hunchback. “Would you like
a cup of tea?” “Oh,” said Mr. Crouch, looking over at Percy in mild
surprise. “Yes — thank you, Weatherby.” Fred and George choked into
their own cups. Percy, very pink around the ears, busied himself with
the kettle. “Oh and I’ve been wanting a word with you too, Arthur,”
said Mr. Crouch, his sharp eyes falling upon Mr. Weasley. “Ali
Bashir’s on the warpath. He wants a word with you about your embargo
on flying carpets.” Mr. Weasley heaved a deep sigh. “I sent him an owl
about that just last week. If I’ve told him once I’ve told him a

Registry of Proscribed Charmable Objects, but will he listen?” “I
doubt it,” said Mr. Crouch, accepting a cup from Percy.
