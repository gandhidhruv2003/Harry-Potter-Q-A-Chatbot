f Magic these days,” said Dumbledore calmly. “I have already given you
my views on this matter, Cornelius.” “Yes, you have,” said Fudge
forcefully, “and I have no reason to believe that your views are
anything other than bilge, Dumbledore. The dementors remain in place
in Azkaban and are doing everything we ask them to.” “Then,” said
Dumbledore, quietly but clearly, “we must ask ourselves why somebody
within the Ministry ordered a pair of dementors into that alleyway on
the second of August.” In the complete silence that greeted these
words, the witch to the right of Fudge leaned forward so that Harry
saw her for the first time. He thought she looked just like a large,
pale toad. She was rather squat with a broad, flabby face, as little
neck as Uncle Vernon, and a very wide, slack mouth. Her eyes were
large, round, and slightly bulging. Even the little black velvet bow
perched on top of her short curly hair put him in mind of a large fly
she was about to catch on a long sticky tongue.
