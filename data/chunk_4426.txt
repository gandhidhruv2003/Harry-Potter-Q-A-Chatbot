istry were breeding —” “No,” said Hermione. She sounded odd. She moved
forward to look through the side of the tank. “They’re brains.”
“Brains?” “Yes . . . I wonder what they’re doing with them?” Harry
joined her at the tank. Sure enough, there could be no mistake now
that he saw them at close quarters. Glimmering eerily they drifted in
and out of sight in the depths of the green water, looking something
like slimy cauliflowers. “Let’s get out of here,” said Harry. “This
isn’t right, we need to try another door —” “There are doors here
too,” said Ron, pointing around the walls. Harry’s heart sank; how big
was this place? “In my dream I went through that dark room into the
second one,” he said. “I think we should go back and try from there.”
So they hurried back into the dark, circular room; the ghostly shapes
of the brains were now swimming before Harry’s eyes instead of the
blue candle flames. “Wait!” said Hermione sharply, as Luna made to
close the door of the brain room behind them.
