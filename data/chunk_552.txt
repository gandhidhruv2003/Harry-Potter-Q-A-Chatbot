bout life at Ron’s, however, wasn’t the talking mirror or the clanking
ghoul: It was the fact that everybody there seemed to like him. Mrs.
Weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force him to
eat fourth helpings at every meal. Mr. Weasley liked Harry to sit next
to him at the dinner table so that he could bombard him with questions
about life with Muggles, asking him to explain how things like plugs
and the postal service worked. “Fascinating!” he would say as Harry
talked him through using a telephone. “Ingenious, really, how many
ways Muggles have found of getting along without magic.” Harry heard
from Hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after he had arrived at
the Burrow. He and Ron went down to breakfast to find Mr. and Mrs.
Weasley and Ginny already sitting at the kitchen table. The moment she
saw Harry, Ginny accidentally knocked her porridge bowl to the floor
with a loud clatter. Ginny seemed very prone to knocking things over
whenever Harry entered a room.
