to him again. . . . Disappointment was burning in his throat. He got

the broken mirror — But then an idea struck him. . . . A better idea

sprinting out of the dormitory and down the spiral staircase, hitting
the walls as he ran and barely noticing. He hurtled across the empty
common room, through the portrait hole and off along the corridor,
ignoring the Fat Lady, who called after him, “The feast is about to
start, you know, you’re cutting it very fine!” But Harry had no
intention of going to the feast . . . How could it be that the place
was full of ghosts whenever you didn’t need one, yet now . . . He ran
down staircases and along corridors and met nobody either alive or
dead. They were all, clearly, in the Great Hall.
