liant!” Wood, too, was basking in the reflected glory of the Firebolt.
“Put it here, Harry,” he said, laying the broom in the middle of the
table and carefully turning it so that its name faced upward. People
from the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables were soon coming over to
look. Cedric Diggory came over to congratulate Harry on having
acquired such a superb replacement for his Nimbus, and Percy’s
Ravenclaw girlfriend, Penelope Clearwater, asked if she could actually
hold the Firebolt. “Now, now, Penny, no sabotage!” said Percy heartily
as she examined the Firebolt closely. “Penelope and I have got a bet
on,” he told the team. “Ten Galleons on the outcome of the match!”
Penelope put the Firebolt down again, thanked Harry, and went back to
her table. “Harry — make sure you win,” said Percy, in an urgent
whisper. “I haven’t got ten Galleons. Yes, I’m coming, Penny!” And he
bustled off to join her in a piece of toast. “Sure you can manage that
broom, Potter?” said a cold, drawling voice.
