over out of Mrs. Weasley’s line of vision and was now sweeping a few
stray doxies from the floor and adding them to his pocket. “But they
still need a bit of work. At the moment our testers are having a bit
of trouble stopping puking long enough to swallow the purple end.”
“Testers?” “Us,” said Fred. “We take it in turns. George did the
Fainting Fancies — we both tried the Nosebleed Nougat —” “Mum thought
we’d been dueling,” said George. “Joke shop still on, then?” Harry
muttered, pretending to be adjusting the nozzle on his spray. “Well,
we haven’t had a chance to get premises yet,” said Fred, dropping his
voice even lower as Mrs. Weasley mopped her brow with her scarf before
returning to the attack, “so we’re running it as a mail-order service
at the moment. We put advertisements in the Daily Prophet last week.”
“All thanks to you, mate,” said George.
