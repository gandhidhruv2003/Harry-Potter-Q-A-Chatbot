bet you’ll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won’t you,
eh?” he said, leering at them. “Oh yes . . . hard work and pain are

oiled in case they’re ever needed. . . . Right, off we go, and don’t
think of running off, now, it’ll be worse for you if you do.” They
marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing. Harry
wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be something

was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into

with Hagrid it wouldn’t be so bad
