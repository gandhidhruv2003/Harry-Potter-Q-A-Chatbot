walk into the station in his wizard’s robes — he’d change on the
train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had
everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and
then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours
later, Harry’s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys’
car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and
they had set off. They reached King’s Cross at half past ten. Uncle
Vernon dumped Harry’s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the
station for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle
Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his
face. “Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine — platform ten. Your
platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don’t seem to
have built it yet, do they?” He was quite right, of course.
