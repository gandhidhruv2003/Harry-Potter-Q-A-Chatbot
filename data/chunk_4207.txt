happened to be the first time he would be in close proximity with
Snape since Snape had thrown him out of his office, as they had
Potions that day. After lying in bed for a while thinking about the

beside Neville’s bed, staring out on a truly glorious morning. The sky

could see the towering beech tree below which his father had once
tormented Snape. He was not sure what Sirius could possibly say to him
that would make up for what he had seen in the Pensieve, but he was
desperate to hear Sirius’s own account of what had happened, to know
of any mitigating factors there might have been, any excuse at all for
his father’s behavior. . . . Something caught Harry’s attention:
movement on the edge of the Forbidden Forest. Harry squinted into the
sun and saw Hagrid emerging from between the trees.
