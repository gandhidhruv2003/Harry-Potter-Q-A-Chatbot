face, already ablaze with excitement. Harry kept smiling and waving,
even though it was like a little bereavement, watching his son glide
away from him. . . . The last trace of steam evaporated in the autumn
air. The train rounded a corner. Harry’s hand was still raised in
farewell. “He’ll be all right,” murmured Ginny. As Harry looked at
her, he lowered his hand absentmindedly and touched the lightning scar
on his forehead. “I know he will.” The scar had not pained Harry for
nineteen years. All was well.   Text copyright © 2007 by J.K. Rowling.
