t, in the Room of Requirement! And Potter was the leader, was he not,
Potter organized it, Potter — why are you shaking your head, girl?”
“Well, usually when a person shakes their head,” said McGonagall
coldly, “they mean ‘no.’ So unless Miss Edgecombe is using a form of
sign language as yet unknown to humans —” Professor Umbridge seized
Marietta, pulled her around to face her, and began shaking her very
hard. A split second later Dumbledore was on his feet, his wand
raised. Kingsley started forward and Umbridge leapt back from
Marietta, waving her hands in the air as though they had been burned.
“I cannot allow you to manhandle my students, Dolores,” said
Dumbledore, and for the first time, he looked angry. “You want to calm
yourself, Madam Umbridge,” said Kingsley in his deep, slow voice. “You
don’t want to get yourself into trouble now.” “No,” said Umbridge
breathlessly, glancing up at the towering figure of Kingsley. “I mean,
yes — you’re right, Shacklebolt — I — I forgot myself.”
