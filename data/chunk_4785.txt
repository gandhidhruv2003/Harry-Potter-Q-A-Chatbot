hree handsome tawnies, each of which, it became clear as they flew
lower over the path leading up to the house, was carrying a large
square envelope. “Oh no!” squealed Hermione. Mrs. Weasley squeezed
past them and opened the kitchen window. One, two, three, the owls
soared through it and landed on the table in a neat line. All three of
them lifted their right legs. Harry moved forward. The letter
addressed to him was tied to the leg of the owl in the middle. He
untied it with fumbling fingers. To his left, Ron was trying to detach
his own results; to his right, Hermione’s hands were shaking so much
she was making her whole owl tremble. Nobody in the kitchen spoke. At
last, Harry managed to detach the envelope. He slit it open quickly
and unfolded the parchment inside. ORDINARY WIZARDING LEVEL RESULTS
