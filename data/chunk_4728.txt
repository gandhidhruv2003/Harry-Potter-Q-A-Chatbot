you must have moved fairly quickly to prepare such a welcome for us at
such short notice,” said Dumbledore. “You can’t have had more than
three minutes’ warning?” Slughorn said, half irritably, half proudly,
“Two. Didn’t hear my Intruder Charm go off, I was taking a bath.
Still,” he added sternly, seeming to pull himself back together again,
“the fact remains that I’m an old man, Albus. A tired old man who’s
earned the right to a quiet life and a few creature comforts.” He
certainly had those, thought Harry, looking around the room. It was
stuffy and cluttered, yet nobody could say it was uncomfortable; there
were soft chairs and footstools, drinks and books, boxes of chocolates
and plump cushions. If Harry had not known who lived there, he would
have guessed at a rich, fussy old lady. “You’re not yet as old as I
am, Horace,” said Dumbledore. “Well, maybe you ought to think about
retirement yourself,” said Slughorn bluntly. His pale gooseberry eyes
had found Dumbledore’s injured hand.
