Hagrid simply looked at him, the little of his face that could be seen
completely blank, uncomprehending. “Dumbledore wha’, Harry?” “He’s
dead. Snape killed him. . . .” “Don’ say that,” said Hagrid roughly.
“Snape kill Dumbledore — don’ be stupid, Harry. Wha’s made yeh say
tha’?” “I saw it happen.” “Yeh couldn’ have.” “I saw it, Hagrid.”
Hagrid shook his head; his expression was disbelieving but
sympathetic, and Harry knew that Hagrid thought he had sustained a
blow to the head, that he was confused, perhaps by the aftereffects of
a jinx. . . . “What musta happened was, Dumbledore musta told Snape
ter go with them Death Eaters,” Hagrid said confidently. “I suppose
he’s gotta keep his cover. Look, let’s get yeh back up ter the school.
Come on, Harry. . . .” Harry did not attempt to argue or explain. He
was still shaking uncontrollably. Hagrid would find out soon enough,
too soon. . . . As they directed their steps back toward the castle,
Harry saw that many of its windows were lit now.
