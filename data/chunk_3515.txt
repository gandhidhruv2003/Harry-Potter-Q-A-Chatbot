Hogwarts much longer and the people who count have a very different —
and probably more accurate — view of Potter’s behavior. I shall say no
more here, but if you look at the Daily Prophet tomorrow you will get
a good idea of the way the wind is blowing — and see if you can spot
yours truly! Seriously, Ron, you do
