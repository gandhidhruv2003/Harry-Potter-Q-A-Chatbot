cauldron. “You have these,” Harry mumbled to her, tipping the books
into the cauldron. “I’ll buy my own —” “Bet you loved that, didn’t
you, Potter?” said a voice Harry had no trouble recognizing. He
straightened up and found himself face-to-face with Draco Malfoy, who
was wearing his usual sneer. “Famous Harry Potter,” said Malfoy.
“Can’t even go into a bookshop without making the front page.” “Leave
him alone, he didn’t want all that!” said Ginny. It was the first time
she had spoken in front of Harry. She was glaring at Malfoy. “Potter,
you’ve got yourself a girlfriend!” drawled Malfoy. Ginny went scarlet
as Ron and Hermione fought their way over, both clutching stacks of
Lockhart’s books. “Oh, it’s you,” said Ron, looking at Malfoy as if he
were something unpleasant on the sole of his shoe. “Bet you’re
surprised to see Harry here, eh?” “Not as surprised as I am to see you

hungry for a month to pay for all those.”
