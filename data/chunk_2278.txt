e’s faced this lot,” said Charlie grimly, looking out over the
dragons’ enclosure. “I didn’t dare tell Mum what he’s got to do for
the first task; she’s already having kittens about him. . . .” Charlie
imitated his mother’s anxious voice. “‘How could they let him enter
that tournament, he’s much too young! I thought they were all safe, I
thought there was going to be an age limit!’ She was in floods after
that Daily Prophet article about him. ‘He still cries about his
parents! Oh bless him, I never knew!’” Harry had had enough. Trusting
to the fact that Hagrid wouldn’t miss him, with the attractions of
four dragons and Madame Maxime to occupy him, he turned silently and
began to walk away, back to the castle. He didn’t know whether he was
glad he’d seen what was coming or not. Perhaps this way was better.
The first shock was over now. Maybe if he’d seen the dragons for the
first time on Tuesday, he would have passed out cold in front of the
whole school . . . but maybe he would anyway.
