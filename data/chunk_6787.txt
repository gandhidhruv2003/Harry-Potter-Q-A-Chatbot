lers. The portraits on either side of the fighters were crammed with
figures screaming advice and encouragement, while Death Eaters, both
masked and unmasked, dueled students and teachers. Dean had won
himself a wand, for he was face-to-face with Dolohov, Parvati with
Travers. Harry, Ron, and Hermione raised their wands at once, ready to
strike, but the duelers were weaving and darting around so much that
there was a strong likelihood of hurting one of their own side if they
cast curses. Even as they stood braced, looking for the opportunity to
act, there came a great “Wheeeeeeeeeeee!” and, looking up, Harry saw
Peeves zooming over them, dropping Snargaluff pods down onto the Death
Eaters, whose heads were suddenly engulfed in wriggling green tubers
like fat worms. “Argh!” A fistful of tubers had hit the Cloak over
Ron’s head; the slimy green roots were suspended improbably in midair
as Ron tried to shake them loose. “Someone’s invisible there!” shouted
a masked Death Eater, pointing.
