eathery cannonball and landed with a clatter on the kitchen table,
causing all three of the Dursleys to jump with fright. Harry tore a
second official-looking envelope from the owl’s beak and ripped it
open as the owl swooped back out into the night. “Enough — effing —
owls . . .” muttered Uncle Vernon distractedly, stomping over to the

letter of approximately twenty-two minutes ago, the Ministry of Magic
has revised its decision to destroy your wand forthwith. You may
retain your wand until your disciplinary hearing on 12th August, at
which time an official decision will be taken. Following discussions
with the headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the
Ministry has agreed that the question of your expulsion will also be
decided at that time. You should therefore consider yourself suspended
from school pending further inquiries. With best wishes, Yours
sincerely, IMPROPER USE OF MAGIC OFFICE Ministry
