Muggles!” said Hermione. “We didn’t hear stories like that when we
were little, we heard ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs’ and
‘Cinderella’ —” “What’s that, an illness?” asked Ron. “So these are

just Charlie, now Mum’s asleep, sneaking off to regrow his hair,” said
Ron nervously. “All the same, we should get to bed,” whispered
Hermione. “It wouldn’t do to oversleep tomorrow.” “No,” agreed Ron. “A
brutal triple murder by the bridegroom’s mother might put a bit of a
damper on the wedding. I’ll get the lights.” And he clicked the
