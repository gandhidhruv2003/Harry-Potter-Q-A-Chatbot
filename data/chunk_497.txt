u through to the dining room, Mrs. Mason?” said Dudley, offering his
fat arm to an invisible woman. “My perfect little gentleman!” sniffed
Aunt Petunia. “And you?” said Uncle Vernon viciously to Harry. “I’ll
be in my room, making no noise and pretending I’m not there,” said
Harry dully. “Precisely. Now, we should aim to get in a few good
compliments at dinner. Petunia, any ideas?” “Vernon tells me you’re a
wonderful golfer, Mr. Mason. . . . Do tell me where you bought your
dress, Mrs. Mason. . . .” “Perfect . . . Dudley?” “How about — ‘We had
to write an essay about our hero at school, Mr. Mason, and I wrote
about you.’” This was too much for both Aunt Petunia and Harry. Aunt
Petunia burst into tears and hugged her son, while Harry ducked under
the table so they wouldn’t see him laughing. “And you, boy?” Harry
fought to keep his face straight as he emerged. “I’ll be in my room,
making no noise and pretending I’m not there,” he said. “Too right,
you will,” said Uncle Vernon forcefully.
