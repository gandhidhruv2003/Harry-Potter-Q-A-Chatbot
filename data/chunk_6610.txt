goblet tumbling from her grip. But as it fell, it split, became a
shower of goblets, so that a second later, with a great clatter, the
floor was covered in identical cups rolling in every direction, the
original impossible to discern amongst them. “It burned me!” moaned
Hermione, sucking her blistered fingers. “They have added Gemino and
Flagrante Curses!” said Griphook. “Everything you touch will burn and
multiply, but the copies are worthless — and if you continue to handle
the treasure, you will eventually be crushed to death by the weight of
expanding gold!” “Okay, don’t touch anything!” said Harry desperately,
but even as he said it, Ron accidentally nudged one of the fallen
goblets with his foot, and twenty more exploded into being while Ron
hopped on the spot, part of his shoe burned away by contact with the
hot metal. “Stand still, don’t move!” said Hermione, clutching at Ron.
“Just look around!” said Harry.
