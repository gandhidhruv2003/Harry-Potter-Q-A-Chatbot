istmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles,
some glittering with hundreds of candles. “How many days you got left
until yer holidays?” Hagrid asked. “Just one,” said Hermione. “And
that reminds me — Harry, Ron, we’ve got half an hour before lunch, we
should be in the library.” “Oh yeah, you’re right,” said Ron, tearing
his eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles
blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of
the new tree. “The library?” said Hagrid, following them out of the
hall. “Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren’t yeh?” “Oh, we’re not
working,” Harry told him brightly. “Ever since you mentioned Nicolas
Flamel we’ve been trying to find out who he is.” “You what?” Hagrid
looked shocked. “Listen here — I’ve told yeh — drop it. It’s nothin’
to you what that dog’s guardin’.” “We just want to know who Nicolas
Flamel is, that’s all,” said Hermione. “Unless you’d like to tell us
and save us the trouble?” Harry added.
