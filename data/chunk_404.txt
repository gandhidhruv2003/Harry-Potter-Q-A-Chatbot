ut at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-
white on the dark leaves. Harry had taken one step toward it when a
slithering sound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of
the clearing quivered. . . . Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure
came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast. Harry,
Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the
unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal’s side, and
began to drink its blood. “AAAAAAAAAAARGH!” Malfoy let out a terrible
scream and bolted — so did Fang. The hooded figure raised its head and
looked right at Harry — unicorn blood was dribbling down its front. It
got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry — he couldn’t move for
fear. Then a pain like he’d never felt before pierced his head; it was
as though his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward.
He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over
Harry, charging at the figure.
