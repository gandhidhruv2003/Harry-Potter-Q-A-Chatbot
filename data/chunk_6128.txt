 “Accio Locket.” Nothing happened, but he had not expected it to; no
doubt Umbridge knew all about protective charms and spells. He
therefore hurried behind her desk and began pulling open the drawers.
He saw quills and notebooks and Spellotape; enchanted paper clips that
coiled snakelike from their drawer and had to be beaten back; a fussy
little lace box full of spare hair bows and clips; but no sign of a
locket. There was a filing cabinet behind the desk: Harry set to
searching it. Like Filch’s filing cabinets at Hogwarts, it was full of
folders, each labeled with a name. It was not until Harry reached the
bottommost drawer that he saw something to distract him from his
search: Mr. Weasley’s file. He pulled it out and opened it. ARTHUR
