then?” she said, as she carried the owl to the window. Harry shrugged;
he was quite as mystified by that as she was, though, oddly, it was
not bothering him very much at the moment. They left the Owlery
together. At the entrance of a corridor that led toward the west wing
of the castle, Cho said, “I’m going this way. Well, I’ll . . . I’ll
see you around, Harry.” “Yeah . . . see you.” She smiled at him and
departed. He walked on, feeling quietly elated. He had managed to have
an entire conversation with her and not embarrassed himself once. . .

called him brave. . . . She did not hate him for being alive. . . . Of

only asked her to the ball before Cedric had, things might have turned
out differently. . . . She had seemed sincerely sorry that she had to
refuse when Harry had asked her. .
