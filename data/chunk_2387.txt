to, eh?” said Ron. “Nose out, Ron, or I’ll burn that for you too,”
said Fred, waving his wand threateningly. “So . . . you lot got dates
for the ball yet?” “Nope,” said Ron. “Well, you’d better hurry up,
mate, or all the good ones will be gone,” said Fred. “Who’re you going
with, then?” said Ron. “Angelina,” said Fred promptly, without a trace
of embarrassment. “What?” said Ron, taken aback. “You’ve already asked
her?” “Good point,” said Fred. He turned his head and called across
the common room, “Oi! Angelina!” Angelina, who had been chatting with
Alicia Spinnet near the fire, looked over at him. “What?” she called
back. “Want to come to the ball with me?” Angelina gave Fred an
appraising sort of look. “All right, then,” she said, and she turned
back to Alicia and carried on chatting with a bit of a grin on her
face. “There you go,” said Fred to Harry and Ron, “piece of cake.” He
got to his feet, yawning, and said, “We’d better use a school owl
then, George, come on. . . .” They left.
