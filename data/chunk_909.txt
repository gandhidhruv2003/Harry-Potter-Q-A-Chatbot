 was almost sure Dumbledore’s eyes flickered toward the corner where
he and Ron stood hidden. “Admirable sentiments,” said Malfoy, bowing.
“We shall all miss your — er — highly individual way of running
things, Albus, and only hope that your successor will manage to
prevent any — ah — killins.” He strode to the cabin door, opened it,
and bowed Dumbledore out. Fudge, fiddling with his bowler, waited for
Hagrid to go ahead of him, but Hagrid stood his ground, took a deep
breath, and said carefully, “If anyone wanted ter find out some stuff,
all they’d have ter do would be ter follow the spiders. That’d lead
’em right! That’s all I’m sayin’.” Fudge stared at him in amazement.
“All right, I’m comin’,” said Hagrid, pulling on his moleskin
overcoat. But as he was about to follow Fudge through the door, he
stopped again and said loudly, “An’ someone’ll need ter feed Fang
while I’m away.” The door banged shut and Ron pulled off the
Invisibility Cloak. “We’re in trouble now,” he said hoarsely.
