hey put in the work.” Neville made a sad little disbelieving noise.
“Yes, you too, Longbottom,” said Professor McGonagall. “There’s
nothing wrong with your work except lack of confidence. So . . . today
we are starting Vanishing Spells. These are easier than Conjuring
Spells, which you would not usually attempt until N.E.W.T. level, but
they are still among the most difficult magic you will be tested on in
your O.W.L.” She was quite right; Harry found the Vanishing Spells
horribly difficult. By the end of a double period, neither he nor Ron
had managed to vanish the snails on which they were practicing, though
Ron said hopefully that he thought his looked a bit paler. Hermione,
on the other hand, successfully vanished her snail on the third
attempt, earning her a ten-point bonus for Gryffindor from Professor
McGonagall. She was the only person not given homework; everybody else
was told to practice the spell overnight, ready for a fresh attempt on
their snails the following afternoon.
