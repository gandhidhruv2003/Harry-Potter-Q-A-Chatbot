Granger has just informed me that you have been sent a broomstick,
Potter.” Harry and Ron looked around at Hermione. They could see her
forehead reddening over the top of her book, which was upside down.
“May I?” said Professor McGonagall, but she didn’t wait for an answer
before pulling the Firebolt out of their hands. She examined it
carefully from handle to twig-ends. “Hmm. And there was no note at
all, Potter? No card? No message of any kind?” “No,” said Harry
blankly. “I see . . . ,” said Professor McGonagall. “Well, I’m afraid
I will have to take this, Potter.” “W-what?” said Harry, scrambling to
his feet. “Why?” “It will need to be checked for jinxes,” said
Professor McGonagall. “Of course, I’m no expert, but I daresay Madam
Hooch and Professor Flitwick will strip it down —” “Strip it down?”
repeated Ron, as though Professor McGonagall was mad. “It shouldn’t
take more than a few weeks,” said Professor McGonagall.
