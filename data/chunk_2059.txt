their first year, a vicious Norwegian Ridgeback by the name of
Norbert. Hagrid simply loved monstrous creatures, the more lethal, the

their way back up to the castle for lunch an hour later. “They are

said that to shut Malfoy up,” said Hermione. “As a matter of fact I

Gryffindor table and helped themselves to lamb chops and potatoes.
Hermione began to eat so fast that Harry and Ron stared at her. “Er —
