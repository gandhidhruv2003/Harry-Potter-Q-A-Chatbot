spoon and attacked the last few mouthfuls of his apple tart. “I can
help, some of it’s my mess,” Harry told Ron, but Mrs. Weasley cut
across him. “No, Harry, dear, I’d much rather you helped Arthur muck
out the chickens, and Hermione, I’d be ever so grateful if you’d

magnificent battery, and it’ll be a great opportunity to find out how
brakes work. I’m going to try and put it all back together again when
Molly’s not — I mean, when I’ve got time.
