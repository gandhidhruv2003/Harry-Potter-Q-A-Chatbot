’t it?” whispered Harry. “Does the wand in your hand know its last
master was Disarmed? Because if it does . . . I am the true master of
the Elder Wand.” A red-gold glow burst suddenly across the enchanted
sky above them as an edge of dazzling sun appeared over the sill of
the nearest window. The light hit both of their faces at the same
time, so that Voldemort’s was suddenly a flaming blur. Harry heard the
high voice shriek as he too yelled his best hope to the heavens,
pointing Draco’s wand: “Avada Kedavra!” “Expelliarmus!” The bang was
like a cannon blast, and the golden flames that erupted between them,
at the dead center of the circle they had been treading, marked the
point where the spells collided. Harry saw Voldemort’s green jet meet
his own spell, saw the Elder Wand fly high, dark against the sunrise,
spinning across the enchanted ceiling like the head of Nagini,
spinning through the air toward the master it would not kill, who had
come to take full possession of it at last.
