“I’ve already told you!” Hermione said very angrily. “I’m going with
someone else!” And she stormed off toward the girls’ dormitories
again. “She’s lying,” said Ron flatly, watching her go. “She’s not,”
said Ginny quietly. “Who is it then?” said Ron sharply. “I’m not
telling you, it’s her business,” said Ginny. “Right,” said Ron, who
looked extremely put out, “this is getting stupid. Ginny, you can go
with Harry, and I’ll just —” “I can’t,” said Ginny, and she went
scarlet too. “I’m going with — with Neville. He asked me when Hermione
said no, and I thought . . . well . . . I’m not going to be able to go
otherwise, I’m not in fourth year.” She looked extremely miserable. “I
think I’ll go and have dinner,” she said, and she got up and walked
off to the portrait hole, her head bowed. Ron goggled at Harry.
“What’s got into them?” he demanded. But Harry had just seen Parvati
and Lavender come in through the portrait hole.
