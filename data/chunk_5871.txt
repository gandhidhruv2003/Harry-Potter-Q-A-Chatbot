short steps into the tiny attic space. His head and shoulders were in
the room before he caught sight of the creature curled up a few feet
from him, fast asleep in the gloom with its large mouth wide open.
“But it . . . it looks . . . do ghouls normally wear pajamas?” “No,”
said Ron. “Nor have they usually got red hair or that number of
pustules.” Harry contemplated the thing, slightly revolted. It was
human in shape and size, and was wearing what, now that Harry’s eyes
became used to the darkness, was clearly an old pair of Ron’s pajamas.
He was also sure that ghouls were generally rather slimy and bald,
rather than distinctly hairy and covered in angry purple blisters.
“He’s me, see?” said Ron. “No,” said Harry. “I don’t.” “I’ll explain
it back in my room, the smell’s getting to me,” said Ron. They climbed
back down the ladder, which Ron returned to the ceiling, and rejoined
Hermione, who was still sorting books.
