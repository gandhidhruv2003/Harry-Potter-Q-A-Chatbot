ents. “Fine, fine,” said Mr. Weasley, a little too heartily. “You — er
— haven’t seen Healer Smethwyck, have you?” “No,” said Mrs. Weasley
suspiciously, “why?” “Nothing, nothing,” said Mr. Weasley airily,
starting to unwrap his pile of gifts. “Well, everyone had a good day?
What did you all get for Christmas? Oh, Harry — this is absolutely
wonderful —” For he had just opened Harry’s gift of fuse-wire and
screwdrivers. Mrs. Weasley did not seem entirely satisfied with Mr.
Weasley’s answer. As her husband leaned over to shake Harry’s hand,
she peered at the bandaging under his nightshirt. “Arthur,” she said,
with a snap in her voice like a mousetrap, “you’ve had your bandages
changed. Why have you had your bandages changed a day early, Arthur?
They told me they wouldn’t need doing until tomorrow.” “What?” said
Mr. Weasley, looking rather frightened and pulling the bed covers
higher up his chest. “No, no — it’s nothing — it’s — I —” He seemed to
deflate under Mrs. Weasley’s piercing gaze.
