soon, Harry,” said Hermione earnestly. “We promise.” Harry nodded. He
somehow could not find words to tell them what it meant to him, to see

in farewell, turned around, and led the way out of the station toward
the sunlit street, with Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley
hurrying along in his wake.   Text copyright © 2003 by J.K. Rowling.
