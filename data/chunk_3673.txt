on in a hushed voice. “When your scar hurt in Umbridge’s office? You-
Know-Who was angry?” Harry shook his head. “What is it, then?” Harry
was thinking himself back. He had been looking into Umbridge’s face. .
. . His scar had hurt . . . and he had had that odd feeling in his
stomach . . . a strange, leaping feeling . . . a happy feeling. . . .
But, of course, he had not recognized it for what it was, as he had
been feeling so miserable himself. . . . “Last time, it was because he
was pleased,” he said. “Really pleased. He thought . . . something
good was going to happen. And the night before we came back to
Hogwarts . . .” He thought back to the moment when his scar had hurt
so badly in his and Ron’s bedroom in Grimmauld Place. “He was furious
. . .” He looked around at Ron, who was gaping at him. “You could take
over from Trelawney, mate,” he said in an awed voice. “I’m not making
prophecies,” said Harry. “No, you know what you’re doing?” Ron said,
sounding both scared and impressed.
