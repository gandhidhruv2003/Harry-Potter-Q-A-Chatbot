 tent because there’s some other damn thing we’ve got to find. Just

Harry. “I don’t know?” Plunk, plunk, plunk. The rain was falling
harder and heavier; it pattered on the leaf-strewn bank all around
them and into the river chattering through the dark. Dread doused
Harry’s jubilation: Ron was saying exactly what he had suspected and
feared him to be thinking. “It’s not like I’m not having the time of
my life here,” said Ron, “you know, with my arm mangled and nothing to
eat and freezing my backside off every night. I just hoped, you know,
after we’d been running round a few weeks, we’d have achieved
something.” “Ron,” Hermione said, but in such a quiet voice that Ron
could pretend not to have heard it over the loud tattoo the rain was
now beating on the tent. “I thought you knew what you’d signed up
for,” said Harry. “Yeah, I thought I did too.” “So what part of it
isn’t living up to your expectations?” asked Harry.
