 “we’ve done enough poking around.” He pulled a map of Jupiter toward
him and started to learn the names of its moons. The following
morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and Neville at the
breakfast table. They were all the same: Your detention will take
place at eleven o’clock tonight. Meet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall.
Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over
the points they’d lost. He half expected Hermione to complain that
this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn’t say a word.
Like Harry, she felt they deserved what they’d got. At eleven o’clock
that night, they said good-bye to Ron in the common room and went down
to the entrance hall with Neville. Filch was already there — and so
was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a
detention, too. “Follow me,” said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading
them outside. “I bet you’ll think twice about breaking a school rule
again, won’t you, eh?” he said, leering at them.
