one were thinking the same as he was. If Snape had been in on
protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out how the other
teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything — except, it
seemed, Quirrell’s spell and how to get past Fluffy. “You’re the only
one who knows how to get past Fluffy, aren’t you, Hagrid?” said Harry
anxiously. “And you wouldn’t tell anyone, would you? Not even one of
the teachers?” “Not a soul knows except me an’ Dumbledore,” said
Hagrid proudly. “Well, that’s something,” Harry muttered to the
others. “Hagrid, can we have a window open? I’m boiling.” “Can’t,
Harry, sorry,” said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance at the fire.
Harry looked at it, too. “Hagrid — what’s that?” But he already knew
what it was. In the very heart of the fire, underneath the kettle, was
a huge, black egg. “Ah,” said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his
beard, “That’s — er . . .” “Where did you get it, Hagrid?” said Ron,
crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg.
