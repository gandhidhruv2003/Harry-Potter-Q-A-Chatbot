 deep breath. “There was Antonin Dolohov,” he said. “I — I saw him
torture countless Muggles and — and non-supporters of the Dark Lord.”
“And helped him do it,” murmured Moody. “We have already apprehended
Dolohov,” said Crouch. “He was caught shortly after yourself.”
“Indeed?” said Karkaroff, his eyes widening. “I — I am delighted to
hear it!” But he didn’t look it. Harry could tell that this news had
come as a real blow to him. One of his names was worthless. “Any
others?” said Crouch coldly. “Why, yes . . . there was Rosier,” said
Karkaroff hurriedly. “Evan Rosier.” “Rosier is dead,” said Crouch. “He
was caught shortly after you were too. He preferred to fight rather
than come quietly and was killed in the struggle.” “Took a bit of me
with him, though,” whispered Moody to Harry’s right. Harry looked
around at him once more, and saw him indicating the large chunk out of
his nose to Dumbledore. “No — no more than Rosier deserved!” said
Karkaroff, a real note of panic in his voice now.
