onfusion . . . that’s how it used to be. “Well, times like that bring
out the best in some people and the worst in others. Crouch’s
principles might’ve been good in the beginning — I wouldn’t know. He

the Unforgivable Curses against suspects. I would say he became as
ruthless and cruel as many on the Dark Side. He had his supporters,
mind you — plenty of people thought he was going about things the
right way, and there were a lot of witches and wizards clamoring for
him to take over as Minister of Magic. When Voldemort disappeared, it
looked like only a matter of time until Crouch got the top job. But
then something rather unfortunate happened. . . .
