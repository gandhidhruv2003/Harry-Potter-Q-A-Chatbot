of hair out of his mustache, something he hadn’t been driven to in a
long time. “I WILL NOT HAVE OWLS HERE, I WILL NOT TOLERATE THIS, I
TELL YOU!” But Harry was already pulling a roll of parchment from the
owl’s leg. He was so convinced that this letter had to be from
Dumbledore, explaining everything — the dementors, Mrs. Figg, what the
Ministry was up to, how he, Dumbledore, intended to sort everything
out — that for the first time in his life he was disappointed to see
Sirius’s handwriting. Ignoring Uncle Vernon’s ongoing rant about owls
and narrowing his eyes against a second cloud of dust as the most
recent owl took off back up the chimney, Harry read Sirius’s message.
Arthur’s just told us what happened. Don’t leave the house again,
whatever you do.   Harry found this such an inadequate response to
everything that had happened tonight that he turned the piece of
parchment over, looking for the rest of the letter, but there was
nothing there. And now his temper was rising again.
