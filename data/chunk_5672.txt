the door to the boys’ dormitories. As he had hoped, Ron was waiting
for him, still fully dressed, sitting on his bed. Harry sat down on
his own four-poster and for a moment, they simply stared at each

said they would,” said Ron. There was a pause. “So?” said Ron in a
very low voice, as though he thought the furniture might be listening

head. All that had taken place around that black lake seemed like an
old nightmare now; had it really happened, and only hours ago? “You
didn’t get it?” said Ron, looking crestfallen. “It wasn’t there?”
“No,” said Harry. “Someone had already taken it and left a fake in its
place.” “Already taken — ?” Wordlessly, Harry pulled the fake locket
