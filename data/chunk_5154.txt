 to make Malfoy speak to Snape like this — Snape, toward whom he had
always shown respect, even liking? “So that is why you have been
avoiding me this term? You have feared my interference? You realize
that, had anybody else failed to come to my office when I had told
them repeatedly to be there, Draco —” “So put me in detention! Report
me to Dumbledore!” jeered Malfoy. There was another pause. Then Snape
said, “You know perfectly well that I do not wish to do either of
those things.” “You’d better stop telling me to come to your office
then!” “Listen to me,” said Snape, his voice so low now that Harry had
to push his ear very hard against the keyhole to hear. “I am trying to
help you. I swore to your mother I would protect you. I made the
Unbreakable Vow, Draco —” “Looks like you’ll have to break it, then,
because I don’t need your protection! It’s my job, he gave it to me
and I’m doing it, I’ve got a plan and it’s going to work, it’s just
taking a bit longer than I thought it would!”
